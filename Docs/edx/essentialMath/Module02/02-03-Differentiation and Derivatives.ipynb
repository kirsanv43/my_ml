    "So far in this course, you've learned how to evaluate limits for points on a line. Now you're going to build on that knowledge and look at a calculus technique called *differentiation*. In differentiation, we use our knowledge of limits to calculate the *derivative* of a function in order to determine the rate of change at an individual point on a line.\n",

    "## Derivative Rules and Operations\n",
    "When working with derivatives, there are some rules, or shortcuts, that you can apply to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Derivative Rules\n",
    "Let's start with some basic rules that it's useful to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *C* (where *C* is a constant), then *f'(x)* = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    This makes sense if you think about it for a second. No matter what value you use for *x*, the function returns the same constant value; so the graph of the function will be a horizontal line. There's no rate of change in a horiziontal line, so its slope is 0 at all points. This is true of any constant, including symbolic constants like *&pi;* (pi).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So, for example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 6 \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 0 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = \\pi \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 0 \\end{equation}\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *Cg(x)*, then *f'(x)* = *Cg'(x)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    This rule tells us that if a function is equal to a second function multiplied by a constant, then the derivative of the first function will be equal to the derivative of the second function multiplied by the same constant. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 2g(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 2g'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *g(x)* + *h(x)*, then *f'(x)* = *g'(x)* + *h'(x)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    In other words, if a function is the sum of two other functions, then the derivative of the first function is the sum of the derivatives of the other two functions. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = g(x) + h(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course, this also applies to subtraction:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = k(x) - l(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = k'(x) - l'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously, functions are just equations encapsulated as a named entity that return a value; and the rules can be applied to any equation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = \\frac{d}{dx} 2x +  \\frac{d}{dx} 6\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can take advantage of the rules to make the calculation a little easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2(x+h) - 2x}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "After factoring out the* 2(x+h)* on the left, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2x + 2h - 2x}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify this to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2h}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can turn our attention to the derivative of the constant 6 with respect to *x*, and we know that the derivative of a constant is always 0, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(6) = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the two derivatives we calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = 2 + 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us our result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = 2\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power Rule\n",
    "The *power rule* is one of the most useful shortcuts in the world of differential calculus. It can be stated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{n} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So if our function for *x* returns *x* to the power of some constant (which we'll call *n*), then the derivative of the function for *x* is *n* times *x* to the power of *n* - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably helpful to look at a few examples to see how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{3} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 3x^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{-2} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = -2x^{-3}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{2} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 2x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, the exponential of *x* in the function definition becomes the coefficient for *x* in the derivative definition, with the exponential is decremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a worked example to find the derivative of the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start with the general derivative function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plug in our definition for *f*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x + h)^{2} - x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can factor out the perfect square binomial on the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x^{2} + h^{2} + 2xh - x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The x<sup>2</sup> terms cancel each other out so we get to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^{2} + 2xh}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} h + 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "With *h* approaching 0, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = 0 + 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So our answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we could have achieved the same result by simply applying the power rule and transforming x<sup>2</sup> to 2x<sup>1</sup> (which is the same as 2x).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Product Rule\n",
    "The product rule can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's break that down. What it's saying is that the derivative of *f(x)* multiplied by *g(x)* is equal to the derivative of *f(x)* multiplied by the value of *g(x)* added to the value of *f(x)* multiplied by the derivative of *g(x*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example based on the following two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 2x^{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}g(x) = x + 1 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by calculating the derivative of *f(x)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2(x + h)^{2} - 2x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This factors out to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2x^{2} + 2h^{2} + 4xh - 2x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which when we cancel out the 2x<sup>2</sup> and -2x<sup>2</sup> is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2h^{2} + 4xh}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} 2h + 4x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "With *h* approaching 0, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = 4x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at *g'(x)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}g'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x + h) + 1 - (x + 1)}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can just remove the brackets on the left and factor out the *-(x + 1)* on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}g'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x + h + 1 - x - 1}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be cleaned up to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}g'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling us to factor *h* out completely to give a constant derivative of *1*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}g'(x) = 1 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we can calculate the derivative for the product of these functions by plugging the functions and the derivatives we've calculated for them into the product rule equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \\end{equation}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = (4x^{2} + 4x) + 2x^{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be further simplified to:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = 2x^{2} \\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}o(x) = 2x \\end{equation}\n",

    "Note that *x* indicates the input for each function. Function *i* takes its input and squares it, and function *o* takes its input and multiplies it by 2. When we use these as a composite function, the *x* value input into the outer function will be the output from the inner function.\n",
